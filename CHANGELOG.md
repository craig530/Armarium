# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Self-host the Inter and Fraunces fonts (via `@fontsource`) instead of
  loading them from Google Fonts. The previous `<link>` tags were silently
  blocked by the app's Content-Security-Policy (`style-src 'self'`), so the
  UI always fell back to system fonts. This also removes an external
  dependency/privacy leak on a self-hosted app.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-14

Initial public release.

### Cataloguing

- Catalogue physical and digital media across three categories: Music, Films
  & TV, and Books.
- Customisable media types ("subtypes") within each category — CD, DVD,
  Blu-ray, 4K Blu-ray, Digital Film, Digital TV Series, Streaming Music,
  Streaming Film, Streaming TV, Book, Graphic Novel and more, with the
  ability to add, rename and reorder your own.
- Barcode scanning via the device camera for quick lookups.
- Manual entry and metadata search as alternatives to scanning.

### Metadata & Search

- Automatic metadata and cover art lookup from TMDB (Films & TV), MusicBrainz
  (Music) and Open Library (Books).
- Full-text search across the catalogue, with a fallback for environments
  without FTS5 support.
- Filtering and sorting by category, type, location, platform, genre and
  year.

### Organisation

- Hierarchical physical locations (e.g. room → shelf → box) with built-in and
  custom icons.
- Digital platforms (e.g. streaming services, storefronts) with built-in and
  custom logos.
- A Settings area for managing locations, platforms and media subtypes.

### Linking physical & digital copies

- Pair a physical and digital copy of the same title into a single unified
  entry with a combined ownership badge.
- Automatic matching of new items against existing ones using shared
  metadata identifiers.
- Manual linking and unlinking of items.

### Users & Security

- JWT-based authentication with a multi-user model and an admin role,
  including granular per-user permission flags (add items, manage locations,
  platforms, media types).
- Admin panel for creating and managing user accounts.
- httpOnly, `SameSite` session cookies for the web app, with
  `Authorization: Bearer` tokens for API/script access.
- SSRF protections on external URL fetches (cover art, Plex) and validated
  file uploads for covers, icons and logos.
- In-process rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

### Import, Export & Backup

- CSV and JSON export of the full library, available to all users.
- Admin-only CSV and JSON import, with validation against existing data.
- On-demand and automatic backups, with old backups pruned automatically.

### Progressive Web App & UX

- Installable as a Progressive Web App, with offline browsing of your
  library.
- Dark mode.
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions.

### Infrastructure

- Docker Compose deployment for production, plus a hot-reload development
  setup.
- Non-root, multi-stage Docker images for both backend and frontend.
- SQLite by default, with optional PostgreSQL support.
- Schema managed via Alembic migrations, with a repository-layer data-access
  pattern (`app/repositories/`) shared by all routers.
- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) running linting, SAST (bandit), dependency
  audits, and the full test suite on every push and pull request.
- Versioned Docker images published to GHCR for each tagged release — see
  [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
